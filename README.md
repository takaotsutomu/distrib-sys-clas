# distrib-sys-clas
My implementation of some classic distributed computing frameworks, algorithms & systems including:  
1. Map/Reduce and Applications
2. Chandy-Lamport Distributed Snapshots
3. Raft Distributed Consensus Protocol
4. Fault-Tolerant Key/Value Storage System
5. Fault-Tolerant Key/Value Store *Sharded*

Picked up from Princeton's COS418 and MIT's 6.824 courses. See README in each project for an overview. 

**Note**: People who are required to write their own code are prohibited from looking at mine before completing their own fully functioning versions. One always learns the most by doing one's own work! especially when fixing one's own bugs.
